# README

# This repo is a technical test in ruby on rails for En voiture Simone.

# Call API User
# In this second exercise, we judge your quality to provide APIs.
# You will have to fill in the methods index, show, create, update and destroy.
# We provide you with the Users controller which contains several methods and the
# interface of the model.
# We assume that this API is public, so no authentication is needed.
